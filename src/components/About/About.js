            <p>
                I am a Junior Web Developer near Chattanooga, Tennessee currently looking for a great fit to kickstart my career. I have worked in healthcare as well as the agriculture industry, so I bring a unique perspective and attitude to working on web applications. I am fueled by my passion for creating. Writing code to make functional components or applications, while also utilizing imaginitive design, gives me an incredible sense of fulfillment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I consider myself a 'forever student.' I am always willing and wanting to learn new technologies/frameworks/ways of doing things that I may not already know. I am dilligent, hard-working, and motivated to getting better each and every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have base skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (MERN Stack), with a goal of becoming an expert in Front-End Development.
